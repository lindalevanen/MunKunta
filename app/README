Mun Kunta -application is an app for inhabitants of the municipality. With it, the inhabitants (atm of Pirkkala and Imatra) can keep up to date
of their municipality's news.

About SharedPreferences:

Only followed municipalities (not all) are stored in shared preferences in the name of "Kuntavalinnat".
Municipalities are stored as key-value-pairs (Int/String kuntaID, boolean active).
The first parameter tells the id of the municipality, the second tells if the municipality is active as in open for the user
so that the app will continue where the user has left off.

Another SharedPreferences file called "MunKuntaBooleans" stores some important boolean values.
Atm it has only one key-value-pair (String "hasOpened", boolean hasFinished).
If the pair exists, the user has opened the app before.
If the value is false, the user has not completed the municipalitySelection. If it's true, the user has completed it and the Municipality selection
screen doesnt need to be shown again to the user.
